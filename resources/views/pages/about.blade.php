     <p><strong>DEA INVESTMENT COMPANY</strong> is a company formed by three self-motivated visionary<br> 
     youths who are university graduates from different professions who came together to form this company <br>
     with mainly the purpose of creating self-employment and in the course creating employment opportunities <br>
     to the large number of unemployed people in Tanzania whose number is overwhelmingly increasing every  <br>
     year.‘DEA’ is a word which was creatively formed from the initials of the names of its core founders purposely <br>
     to produce a sound of the English word “DARE”. This name reflects that the founders are committed to make <br>
     this company a success. With this new project on watermelon cultivation, the company is set to create a <br>
     base for funding most of its projects by creating capital from this short-term project that it may realize <br>
     more of its goals and targets in creating more employment and increasing production in agriculture since it <br>
     is the world goal now.</p>
